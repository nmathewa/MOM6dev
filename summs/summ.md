# Model setup 

## Domain setup 

1. Closed boundaries. Fake rigid wall is set in the Southern face
2. All the mosaic files are made using FRE-NC tools

## Initial conditions 

1. HYCOM 41 level initial conditions are used 
2. 2013-01-01-00:00:00

## Boundary conditions 

1. Since all 4 walls are closed ,  simulation will run in closed boundary condition

## Forcing datasets

1. Datasets from ERA5-reanalysis
   1. wind ,U10 and V10
   2. temp , T at 2 meters
   3. specific humidity 
   4. sea level pressure

All the units, and attributes in match with the MOM6 (MOM5, since MOM6 does not have any official guidline for creating forcing datasets) requirements
