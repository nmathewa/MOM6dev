# Results

1. The model surface salinity is negatively correlated to observational values which indicates that model is poor at picking up observational patterns 
2. Addition of surface runoff and precipitation are greatly improved the results and more close to observational values
3. The current components (U and V) are close to the observational values.
4. The correlation coefficients of U and V also suggests and the values are positively correlated and model is picking up realistic current pattterns
5. Generally simulations with runoff flux and precipitation increased the model performace by large extend
