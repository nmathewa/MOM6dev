# Open Boundary file generation

We use the OBC for southern and western boundary of the domain. We shall use CDO and python for making the OBC files.

## Download the data
We will use the Copernicus Marine Ensemble reanalyses product which has daily frequency. Take a spread of 0.5 degree around the boundary like if -4 N is the southern boundary take -4.5N to -3.5N as the data files(and spanning the longitude).
